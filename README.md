# gecsgame
repository for the GECS Video Game Club

This repository has been created to hold shared files for the video game development students at Golden Eagle Charter School.
The game we are building this year (2016/17) is a 2D scifi platformer with several levels, easter eggs, and puzzles. The title
is still to be determined. We are ctreating many 2D game assets including sprites, spritesheets, and C# scripts. Since each
student works on his/her own computer, this repository is set up to sync the projects and keep all assets updated on each pc.
All artwork and scripts are MIT licensed and you are free to use them in your own projects.

Once our game is completed, this repository will be made into a tutorial for middle and highschool students and we will create 
branches for future school projects. If you are interested in contributing to our class project or have any questions for me or
our students, please contact me here on github.
